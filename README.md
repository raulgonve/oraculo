# Oracle AI

Oracle AI is an advanced astrology platform that allows users to generate their natal (astral) chart and explore in-depth interpretations of their astrological elements. It also includes features to generate daily horoscopes and chat with an AI expert in astrology.

## Project Overview

The project is centered around the generation of the user's astral chart, providing a detailed summary of their chart and explanations of each astrological element, aspects, and advanced elements. Additionally, users can generate their daily horoscope and chat with an AI-powered astrology expert, "Astrobot," to ask questions or even generate images related to their conversations.

### Modules

- **Dashboard**: A summary view of the user's natal chart with key astrological elements.
- **Astral Chart**: Allows the user to generate their complete astral chart, and it provides an audio summary of the chart.
- **Astrobot**: An AI-powered expert in astrology that can chat with users, answer their astrological questions, and generate related images based on their conversations.
